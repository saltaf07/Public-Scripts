## Purpose
Render a styled checkbox with a label.

The default export from the `Checkbox` component file is `CheckboxWithLabel` that we expect to suffice most of the time. In the event that we require lower-level control over the placement/layout of the checkbox relative to the label, there is also a named export of `Checkbox` that we can use in conjunction with a `<label htmlFor={id}>` element.
