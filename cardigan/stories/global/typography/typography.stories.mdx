# Typography

## Scale at breakpoints
We have seven possible sizes for type, numbered `0` to `6`, with `0` being the largest and `6` the smallest.

Each of these sizes is responsive, being largest at the large breakpoint, becoming smaller at the medium breakpoint and smaller still at the smallest breakpoint.

In the table below, you can see that if a font is declared to be size `0`, it will be `50px` at the large breakpoint, `40px` at the medium breakpoint and `32px` at the small breakpoint.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.scale} />
</Canvas>

## Font families

We use Wellcome Bold, Helvetica Neue, and Lettera on the site.
