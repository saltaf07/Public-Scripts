# Our beta collections search

Our collections search is currently in beta, which means we’re developing the service in public for our users. It’s a work in progress, and subject to change based on your feedback and testing.

As part of this work, we will bring together library collections, physical and digital alike, into a single place. Here you will be able to search, browse, read and do research across the whole Wellcome library catalogue. You can also search for downloadable images from our collections.

For the most comprehensive search of all of our collections, and to request access to physical items from the library, the [main catalogue search](https://search.wellcomelibrary.org) on wellcomelibrary.org  is still available. There you can search the library and archive catalogues for complete coverage of the collections and their data.

## What you can do now

### Library catalogue search
- Find all records for physical books, archive collections, manuscripts, visual collections including artworks and audio-visual materials
- Find all of our digitised material to view online and download 
- Filter your search by date, format, genre, subject and contributor.

### Images search
- Find single images from our historical collections and contemporary biomedical images that you can download freely
- Find visually similar images
- Filter your search by colour, contributor, genre and licence

# Get involved

We want to share our work in progress with you, and to get your feedback throughout the development.

If you’d like to help shape how this website works, we invite you to [join our user panel](https://wellcomecollection.org/user-panel). We’re looking for people at all levels of research experience to participate in the design process.

As a panellist, you’ll be invited to take part in occasional activities which help us test new designs, functionality and features. These activities may be in-person interviews, brief interactive tests, and surveys. You do not need to be present in London to participate; all activities are currently being conducted online.

[Join our user panel](https://wellcomecollection.org/user-panel) today to get involved.
