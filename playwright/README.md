# E2E tests

The core reason for E2E tests is to ensure that our site is as accessible as possible for the people using it.

E2E tests are based on [user stories](./user-stories). [What's in a story](https://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/)?

We write tests around [how our services are used](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles) over testing implementation.

We should consider the different ways in which our services can be accessed by using [selectors and drivers that the people using our site would use](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#best-practices).
